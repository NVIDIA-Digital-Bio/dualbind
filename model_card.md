# DualBind Overview

## Description: <br>
DualBind is a state-of-the-art 3D structure-based deep learning model that predicts protein-ligand binding affinity, which plays a critical role in drug discovery. It leverages 3D structural information and employs a dual-loss framework to effectively learn the binding energy landscape. Trained on AB-FEP-calculated labels, DualBind achieves accurate and generalizable predictions at a fraction of the computational cost of physics-based approaches.

This model is ready for non-commercial use and is for research and development only.<br>

## Model Architecture: <br> 
**Architecture Type:** Graph Neural Networks (GNN) <br>
**Network Architecture:** Transformer, Frame Averaging Neural Network (FANN) <br>

DualBind employs a dual-loss framework, which combines supervised mean squared error (MSE) loss with unsupervised denoising score matching (DSM) loss to effectively learn the binding energy function. The network architecture is a 3D-invariant graph neural network. Specifically, it is built based on Frame Averaging Neural Network (FANN), within which Transformer layers are used.

# Training and Testing Datasets: <br>   
DualBind is trained and tested on the [ToxBench dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08966). <br> 

## Training/Testing Dataset: <br>

**Link:** [ToxBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/karlleswing/toxbench) <br>
**Data Collection Method by dataset:** 
Synthetic (complex structures are generated by Schrodinger's docking method) <br>
**Labeling Method by dataset:** 
Synthetic (affinity labels are computed by Schrodinger's physics-based computational method, ABFEP) <br>
**Properties:** ToxBench is the first large-scale AB-FEP dataset designed for ML development and focused on a single pharmaceutically critical target, Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERa). ToxBench contains 8,770 ERa-ligand complex structures with binding free energies computed via AB-FEP. Using a 70%/15%/15% random split and ensuring no SMILES overlap, we obtain 5,651 training data, 1,202 validation data, and 1,204 test data. <br>

## Inference: <br>
**Engine:** PyTorch <br>
**Test Hardware:** A100 <br>
