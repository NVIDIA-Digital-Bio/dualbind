# DualBind Overview

## Description

DualBind is a state-of-the-art 3D structure-based deep learning model that predicts protein-ligand binding affinity, which plays a critical role in drug discovery. It leverages 3D structural information and employs a dual-loss framework to effectively learn the binding energy landscape. Trained on AB-FEP-calculated labels, DualBind achieves accurate and generalizable predictions at a fraction of the computational cost of physics-based approaches.

This model is ready for non-commercial use and is for research and development only.

## Model Architecture

**Architecture Type:** Graph Neural Networks (GNN)  
**Network Architecture:** Transformer, Frame Averaging Neural Network (FANN)

DualBind employs a dual-loss framework, which combines supervised mean squared error (MSE) loss with unsupervised denoising score matching (DSM) loss to effectively learn the binding energy function. The network architecture is a 3D-invariant graph neural network. Specifically, it is built based on Frame Averaging Neural Network (FANN), within which Transformer layers are used.

# Training and Testing Datasets

DualBind is trained and tested on the [ToxBench dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08966).

## Training/Testing Dataset

**Link:** [ToxBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/karlleswing/toxbench)

**Data Collection Method by dataset:**  
Synthetic (complex structures are generated by Schrodinger's docking method)

**Labeling Method by dataset:**  
Synthetic (affinity labels are computed by Schrodinger's physics-based computational method, ABFEP)

**Properties:**  
ToxBench is the first large-scale AB-FEP dataset designed for ML development and focused on a single pharmaceutically critical target, Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERα). ToxBench contains 8,770 ERα-ligand complex structures with binding free energies computed via AB-FEP. Using a 70%/15%/15% random split and ensuring no SMILES overlap, we obtain 5,651 training data, 1,202 validation data, and 1,204 test data.

## Inference

**Engine:** PyTorch  
**Test Hardware:** A100
